# Pixel Art Maker Project

Creating a single-page web app that lets users create a pixeled drawings on a adjustable grid.
Working with starter code of HTML and CSS to build the app, I implemented JavaScript code that allows the user to customize a grid, and color in cells to create a digital work of art!
